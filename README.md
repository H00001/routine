## What is routine

A fast routine implemented by C

Routine is a lightweight thread. Although it is a thread, it has advantages and features that threads do not have.

+ Context of routine change is faster than context of thread.
+ Routine is much lighter and easier to manipulate than thread.
+ The way to switch routine is cooperative, not preemptive.
+ Context of routine switching doesn't go into the kernel, so there's no need to interrupt or get trap.
